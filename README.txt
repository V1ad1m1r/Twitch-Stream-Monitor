A simple monitor using the twitch API that shows whether or not an individual channel is currently streaming. 

Future updates will include the ability to add and "save" your own channels. Currently you have to adjust the channel array in index.js. 
Future updates will also adjust so that online items are at the top of the complete list, and solve the small issue with the logos at page load.

Each channel is displayed as its own div, for styling purposes.
